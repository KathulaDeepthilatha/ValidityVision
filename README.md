## 📖 About The Project

**ValidityVision** is a modern web application designed to help households reduce food waste and ensure product safety. Built for the **2025 ValidityVision Hackathon**, this application acts as a smart digital pantry.

By leveraging simulated AI recognition, it allows users to scan product labels to get instant insights into shelf life, ingredient safety (allergens, vegan status), and nutritional value.
